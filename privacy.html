    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: February 2026</strong></p>

    <h2>1. The "No Data" Promise</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or see any of your personal data (names, emails, etc.) on our own servers. Your game progress is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party "Modular" Services</h2>
    <p>To provide features like ad-removal and gameplay rewards, we integrate industry-standard third-party SDKs. These services may collect device identifiers (like Advertising IDs) and IP addresses to function.</p>

    <p><strong>Current Active Providers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Services:</strong> Google Play Services / Apple App Store Connect (for basic app functionality).</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Google Play Billing / Apple IAP (to process your "Remove Ads" or "Skins" purchases).</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> [Pending Provider - e.g., AdMob or Unity Ads]. <em>Note: No advertising identifiers are collected until an ad network is integrated.</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't store your data, "deleting your data" is as simple as uninstalling the app or clearing the app cache. For third-party data, you can reset your Advertising ID in your device's System Settings.</p>

    <h2>4. Target Audience</h2>
    <p>This app is intended for users <strong>aged 18 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>
